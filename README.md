Roguelike (or rogue-like) is a subgenre of role-playing video games characterized by a dungeon crawl through procedurally generated levels, turn-based gameplay, grid-based movement, and permanent death of the player character. ~ Wikipedia

In one of my first project i decided to stay in Windows Shell.
My Rougelike Deamons and Dragons has:
- 3 levels that are just 2D lists
- 3 monster types
- NPC you can interact
- Items (keys) that you need to go further
- Food/Potions to Heal
- Items that boost your statistic after pickoup
- Turn-based battle system with attack/heal
- SmartEquip (characters always equip better item if founded)
- Boss fight

These project was written in 2 sprints (4 days each), was separated to several files to better management. Rougelike game was one of my firsts projects ever, so code can be a little messy :).
